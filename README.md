I join the FP20 Analytics Challenges, and happily it is the E-commerce topic that I am very familiar to. This dashboard is inspired by the designs that I already built during the time at hashtag#TikTokShop!

𝟮. 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲? 💹

• Our Corporate Segment only achieved 20-26% GMV Growth YoY, 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝟯𝟬% 𝗬𝗼𝗬 𝗧𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁

• Profit Margin dropped alot from 18% in 2022 to 12.8% in 2023, all market & product categories 𝗱𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗱 𝗯𝗲𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝟭𝟱% 𝘁𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁

• Corporate Segment has the highest AOV (Avg. Order Value), but it dropped a lot in 2023. We need to 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗔𝗢𝗩 𝗯𝘆 𝗼𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗦𝗞𝗨𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗽𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀

• We understand that %Discount of Corporate orders already ~ 15% (likely maximum rate). We should not increase %Discount but rather 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝘂𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗢𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗱 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝘀.

• Our Discount strategy did not work well, where APAC and Africa have disruptively high discount rate (~18.4%). Look into other market, seems 𝟭𝟱% 𝗼𝗿 𝗯𝗲𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗯𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗹𝘁𝗵𝘆 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁 𝗥𝗮𝘁𝗲 overall

• Same logic, to improve Profit margin but not affect GMV Growth, we should try to 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗢𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 %𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁 𝗥𝗮𝘁𝗲. Thereby, more customers will be able to access to discounts, potentially leading more GMV growth but not affect our profit margin
